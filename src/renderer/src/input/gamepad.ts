 *
 * Buttons count from every pad; axes only from the active one, the pad that
 * last had a button pressed. An axis says nothing about whether anybody is
 * holding the pad — a stick rests off centre or drifts, and on a pad Chromium
 * has no mapping for, the axes read as a hat may be something else at rest —
 * so an idle pad's axes would hold a direction down for as long as it stays
 * plugged in. For the same reason a stick moves the focus but never decides
 * which hints are shown.
 *
 * Until some pad is active, a stick pushed out of the dead zone makes its pad
 * the active one, so the stick works before the first press. Crossing the dead
 * zone is the proof — a resting stick holds still, wherever it rests — and it
 * counts only then: once a pad is active, a light gun's aim sweeps its axes
 * through the dead zone whenever it is pointed, and must not take the focus
 * from the pad in hand.
 *
 * A pad on its own is active without a press. There is no other pad its axes
 * could be mistaken for, and a pad whose d-pad is a hat must not need a button
 * pressed before the d-pad works.
