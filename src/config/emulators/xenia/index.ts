/**
 * Xenia Canary — an Xbox 360 emulator, the actively developed fork of Xenia.
 *
 *  - It is **not on Flathub**. Its Linux build is an AppImage attached to every
 *    release of the main repository, so it is found by looking for a file.
 *  - It covers **exactly one system**, which is what the per-system pin in
 *    `settings.systemEmulators` is for.
 *  - It needs **no BIOS**: it reimplements the console's kernel rather than
 *    running a dump, so `dirs.bios` names nothing.
 *  - Its saves are keyed by **profile and title id** rather than by ROM name,
 *    and the title id sits inside the game's executable header. The content
 *    tree is therefore reported as shared, the same answer EmuDeck's Xenia
 *    gives.
 *
 * Outside portable mode it keeps everything under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Xenia`, which
 * is `~/.local/share/Xenia` — see `GetUserFolder` in its
 * `base/filesystem_posix.cc`. An AppImage is not sandboxed, so that is the
 * real folder. Portable mode needs a `portable.txt` beside the executable,
 * which inside a read-only AppImage mount cannot be there.
